\title{Distance on a grid}

\description{
The function calculates the distance to cells of a RasterLayer when the path has to go through the centers of neighboring raster cells (currently only implemented as a 'queen' case in which cells have 8 neighbors).
 
The distance is in meters if the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the RasterLayer is longitude/latitude (\code{+proj=longlat}) and in the units of the CRS (typically meters) in other cases. 
 
Distances are computed by summing local distances between cells, which are connected with their neighbours in 8 directions.

\usage{
\S4method{gridDistance}{RasterLayer}(x, origin, omit=NULL, filename="", ...) 
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{RasterLayer}
\item{origin}{value(s) of the cells from which the distance is calculated}
\item{omit}{value(s) of the cells which cannot be traversed (optional)}
\item{filename}{character. output filename (optional)}
\item{...}{additional arguments as for \code{\link{writeRaster}}}  
}


\seealso{See \code{\link[raster]{distance}} for 'as the crow flies' distance. Additional distance measures and options (directions, cost-distance) are available in the '\code{gdistance}' package.} 


\details{
If the RasterLayer to be processed is big, it will be processed in chunks. This may lead to errors in the case of complex objects spread over different chunks (meandering rivers, for instance). You can try to solve these issues by varying the chunk size, see function setOptions().
