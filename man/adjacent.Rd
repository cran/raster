\title{Adjacent cells}

\description{
Identify cells that are adjacent to a set of cells on a raster. 
}

\usage{
adjacent(x, cells, directions=4, pairs=TRUE, target=NULL, sorted=FALSE, 
         include=FALSE, id=FALSE) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Raster* object}
  \item{cells}{vector of cell numbers for which adjacent cells should be found. Cell numbers start with 1 in the upper-left corner and increase from left to right and from top to bottom}
  \item{directions}{the number of directions in which cells should be connected: 4 (rook's case), 8 (queen's case), 16 (knight and one-cell queen moves), or 'bishop' to connect cells with one-cell diagonal moves. Or a neigborhood matrix (see Details)}
  \item{pairs}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a matrix of pairs of adjacent cells is returned. If \code{FALSE}, a vector of cells adjacent to \code{cells} is returned}
  \item{target}{optional vector of target cell numbers that should be considered. All other adjacent cells are ignored}
  \item{sorted}{logical. Should the results be sorted? }
  \item{include}{logical. Should the focal cells be included in the result? }
  \item{id}{logical. Should the id of the cells be included in the result? (numbered from 1 to length(cells) }
 }

\details{
A neighborhood matrix identifies the cells around each cell that are considered adjacent. The matrix should have one, and only one, cell with value 0 (the focal cell); at least one cell with value 1 (the adjacent cell(s)); All other cells are not considered adjacent and ignored.
}


\value{
matrix or vector with adjacent cells. 
}
