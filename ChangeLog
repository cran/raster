--- 10-October-2011, version 1.9-25
Functions re-implemented using C routines for better speed: focal (a combination of old functions focal, focalNA and focalFilter), distance, direction, and reclass and slopeAspect.
slopeAspect is replaced by 'terrain' to do slope, aspect and other elevation derived terrain characteristics.

--- 27-September-2011, version 1.9-21
mask now works for the a RasterStack/Brick and Spatial* objects. Bug reported by Robert Buitenwerf

--- 22-September-2011, version 1.9-18
option "useRaster" to plot. To use 'image' rather than 'rasterImage', because rasterImage not working on some platforms (windows server); in R versions above 2.13.0. The default is FALSE because 'image' is not working well in R 2.13.1 (it draws white lines over the image); but this was fixed in 2.13.1-patched and above.
Bug fix: new plot argument 'addfun' interfered with old argument 'add' such that 'add=T' did not work (reported by Achilleas Psomas)

--- 21-September-2011, version 1.9-17
Big speed gain (~50 times) for 'calc' with a RasterLayer. calc used apply(x, 1, fun), which is more natural for RasterStackBrick objects, where it simply should use fun(x).
this can now be tested using (currently undocumented) arguments forcefun=TRUE or forceapply=TRUE

--- 15-September-2011, version 1.9-13
Removed backwards compatibility issue (x <- normalizePath(x)  instead of x <- normalizePath(x, winslash = "/", FALSE), when creating raster from file). Reported by Julian Zeidler.

new arguments to plot: fun (to transform values, e.g. log) and addfun to add e.g. points or polygons to each map in a RasterStack
new argument to mask: inverse=FALSE to do mask areas that _are_ NA (rather than are _not_ NA) in the mask
layerNames are now preserved when writing to (.grd) files. Bug reported by Steven Mosher.
Bug fix: pairs did not show the correlation coefficient where there were NA values (reported by Jane Elith)

--- 28-August-2011, version 1.9-8
Improved handling of multifile ncdf files & varname argument, suggested by Matt Fischer. 
cluster support for raster::predict function (run beginCluster() before using predict); but so far this seems to slow things down! 
Much improved speed of the extract function for Raster objects with many layers. Low speed was a problem reported by Jan Verbesselt

Replacement functions implemented for RasterStack/Brick objects (e.g., x[x<1] <- NA )

--- 10-July-2011, version 1.8-42
removed '$size' from list returned by 'blockSize' function (because size can be different for last block). Use $nrows[i] instead.

A warning is given when a rotated image is used (suggested by Agustin Lobo)
New function 'rectify' to unrotate rasters
Very limited initial support for rotated rasters (typically sat images). Many of the existing functions will work with these images, but results can be wrong. Should work OK for simple raster algebra etc. but probably not when joining data spatially.  Although basic extract with coordinates should work OK now.

Bug fixes in dropLayer for a RasterBrick (reported by Steven Mosher)

ext(filename) <- 'x'  now only removes the old extension if it has less than 5 characters (including the dot).

It is now possible to do Arith (e.g. addition, multiplication) with a RasterStack or Brick using a vector argument of lenght that equals nlayers(object).
E.g. you can mutliply a RasterStack with 5 layers with vector c(1,3,5,3,1), where indices are matched to layers.

It is also possible to do Arith & Math with mutliple RasterStackBrick objects (as long as nlayers is the same) and with a RasterStack/Brick and a RasterLayer objects.

unit='vector' ; to store the unit of the layer(s), e.g. "kg m-2 s-1"
zname='character' ; to store the name of the z (layers) variable, e.g. "time"
zvalue='vector' ; to store the values of the z variable, e.g. the dates corresponding to each later
These slots are now filled for values from netcdf files with "CF" type convention (e.g. cmip), with an attempt to covert "days since" to a Date (coverted to string).
Not yet used in writing, or with other formats

--- 2-Aug-2010, version 1.3-8

New clump function, now always using igraph (also for large rasters) & minor bug fix

Fixes to subs function (needs more checking)

To allow for better behaviour when using objects derived from Raster* objects (perhaps in other packages), replaced code like
  if (class(x) == 'RasterLayer') 
with
  if (inherits(x, 'RasterLayer'))
